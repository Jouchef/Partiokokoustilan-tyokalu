# Partiokokoustilan-tyokalu
Web app build from this project will be used by scout group Rastipartio to track the usage of their inventory (saws, tents, lanterns...). App will also be used to upkeep database about how many people use the space and when. This information is needed for Helsinki, and the amount of the yearly allowance city is paying to the Rastipartio is partly dictated by this information. ("24.1.2021, 1 man, 2 women, 10 boys, 9 girls")

In Finland, most scouts call their meeting place "kolo". In english it would be "burrow", tho probably this term is not used in english.

1. Ability to register user to web app.
2. User can be moderator, or normal user

  3.1. How long? What items? How many? who lends?
  3.2. User can easily search item by its name or description.

  4.1. For example: ("24.1.2021, 1 man, 2 women, 10 boys, 9 girls")
5. Administrator have the ability to accept user registering requests, because this system will be closed to specific people.
6. Administrator have the ability to make normal user administrator and administrator to normal user.

  8.1. Item has name, description, location and amount of them. (maybe picture)
9. Admins are able to print summary from "kolo-diary" for the use of the Rastipartio ry board.
